# The Readme Generator

## This is CLI that will generate a unique Readme for a user.
This application is intended to allow a user to easily create a professional README file by inputing a few lines of data. This will save developers time and energy when creating projects. This project works by using user-input questions about a user's repo and taking that input to write a README file in seconds. 

## Installing this project.
This project doesn't require any installation. You just have to open an inergrated terminal in VS Code and type "node index.js"
